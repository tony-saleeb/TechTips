# Numerical Analysis App

A comprehensive Flutter mobile application focused on numerical analysis methods, designed to help users understand and apply various numerical algorithms.

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: The app serves as an educational tool for numerical methods, providing both theory and interactive implementations of common numerical algorithms.

**Technology Stack**:
- Flutter for the UI framework
- Dart as the programming language
- Flutter Riverpod for state management
- Various libraries for rendering mathematical charts (fl_chart), parsing mathematical expressions (math_expressions), and UI enhancements

## Core Features

1. **Two Main Categories of Numerical Methods**:
   - **Root Finding Methods** (Chapter 1): Techniques for finding solutions to equations of the form f(x) = 0
   - **Linear Algebra Methods** (Chapter 2): Algorithms for solving systems of linear equations

2. **Implemented Numerical Methods**:
   - **Root Finding**: Bisection, False Position, Simple Fixed Point, Newton's Method, Secant Method
   - **Linear Algebra**: Gauss Elimination, LU Decomposition, Gauss-Jordan, Cramer's Rule

3. **For Each Method**:
   - Detailed input screens with parameter configuration
   - Step-by-step solution visualization
   - Graphical representation (where applicable)
   - Mathematical explanations and debugging information

4. **UI/UX Features**:
   - Modern, responsive design with Material 3 styling
   - Dark/light theme support
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Interactive elements for better learning experience
